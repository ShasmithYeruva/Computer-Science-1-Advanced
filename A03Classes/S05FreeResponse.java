A big part of using classes in Java is thinking about the
design of the class. You’ll need to figure out what information
needs to be in the blueprint. So far we’ve seen a handful
of examples. In our Rectangle class, we needed to know the
width and height. For our Student class, we needed to know
the first name, last name, and grade level.

This exercise is a free response question. Imagine that someone comes
to you and asks you to design a class that represents a
Pizza. 
1) What instance variables should the Pizza class have? It should have variables defining the topping, the price, and the crust type.
2) Why? This is because it relates to the items that create the pizza as well as other factors relating to it.
3) What are the types of those instance variables? They are all strings other than the price which is a double.
